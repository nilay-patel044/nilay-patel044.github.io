Simple! I chose Bloc for its curriculum and the connections it's mentors and members have in the technology field. Before selecting Bloc as my choice of boot-camp, I did extensive research on how much am I paying? what am I getting for what I am paying? is it worth it? do they offer any job guarantee? how lenient are they with study schedule? do I have to travel? do they have a community of members or just current students and mentors?

I know those are a lot of questions, but so are $8900. As I mentioned before, I wasted a lot of money unnecessarily in school. Schooling is worth every penny, if done right and put to good use. Since I wasn't focused enough in school due to personal reasons, I consider the money wasted. I had to borrow that money from my uncle to give myself a new start. After enrolling in Bloc's Web Development curriculum, I was given an option to choose a mentor.

Yes, I had access to every available mentor's background, their stories, and their skills listed on their personal website. I chose Mark Carpenter as my mentor because he is well-off in the industry. He is seasoned in the industry with variety of skills and passion for different projects. He also has good personal connections in the industry.

Mark has an amazing personality. He has true passion for technology. He is not afraid to tell the truth whether that means hurting my ego or saying "NO" to my idea if it's stupid or going to backfire on me. He is very flexible with his schedule and goes out of his way to help his mentees. I have noticed that during few personal and work emergencies that I have had before. Just like any classroom, Bloc's curriculum and their instructions on assignments are not always straight-forward. We think through the problems together and find a solution. I am always willing to attempt at solving the problem first. Thereafter, If I still don't get an answer, I will ping Mark for rescue.

Through Bloc, I have learned the basics and insider tips on HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, DOM Tree and Event Handling, Vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery like helper libraries. I learned them step by step. In the creation of BlocJams project, we first created a dummy website using HTML and CSS. Second, we refactored that code using HTML5 and CSS3 standards. The DOM Tree and Event Handling was explained through external assignments and articles. Third, I was introduced to JavaScript and had to include that in the code. Choo!!!

Thereafter, I learned about jQuery and how it significantly reduces the amount of code we must write. The jQuery not only reduces the amount of code and makes it readable, but it simplifies complex element selection, animation usage, and event handling. By the completion of BlocJams, majority of the JavaScript code had been refactored to jQuery methods, variables, and calls, while HTML/CSS code refactored to HTML5/CSS3 to meet the modern browsers' standards.  

I have been learning frontend development using Bloc's curriculum with the mentorship from my mentor for about two months. I have seen, read, and completed checkpoints and assignments in as little as 30 minutes to as much as 5 hours. I have even pulled my hair out, just to realize the error was syntactical or my computer needed to be restarted. With Bloc's curriculum and industry seasoned mentors, you get what is shown to you. They will work hard to help you, if you work hard to attempt at it and seek assistance promptly.
